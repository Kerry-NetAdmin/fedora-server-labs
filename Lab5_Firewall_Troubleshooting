Lab 5 â€“ Firewall and Network Troubleshooting

Objective: Configure firewall rules and test basic troubleshooting commands for network services.

Checking Firewall Status
sudo firewall-cmd --state
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

Allowing Services Through the Firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dns --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=ntp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Basic Troubleshooting Commands
ping 192.168.56.1
traceroute google.com
dig classroom.local
systemctl status named
journalctl -xe

In this lab I worked with `firewalld` to make sure essential services like DHCP, DNS and NTP are allowed through the server's firewall. I also used basic troubleshooting tools like `ping`, `dig`, and `systemctl status` to verify that the services were running correctly and reachable.
